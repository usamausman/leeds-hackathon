This is a repository for the Leeds Hackathon 2019. The product developed by team Hackatonne was a fob that in combination with biometric
data helps identify a person. This was an idea that targets mainly homeless people, as we can have some sort of 2FA that works by having
both the fob and the persons biometric data without relying on more expensive means, like a passport, that could be lost.

The way identification is done is by showing the fob and then using a fingerprint scanner on the shop that confirms the identity. Obviously,
this assumes that every person has been registered on a database when they were born.

The project makes use of a raspberry Pi with an RFID tag reader that connects to another raspberry Pi, which acts as a server. We also designed
a website and Adnroid application to identify the fingerprint.
